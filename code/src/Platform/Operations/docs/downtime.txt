The goal of the this operation is to determine the reason for downtime of a application
Check the application log to see if there are any errors, 
Only if error status is yellow or red then check for most common error, 
If status of logs were green we proceed to checking the queue health
If the most common error is database related then check the database connection 
If the database connection is up then check if too many connections are made to database 
If database is the not the issue then check queue health
to check the queue health check the queload and then check the queue response time
If database health is red or the queue health is red then we know that it is the cause of the downtime
When the cause of the downtime is confirmed then summarize the analysis done and complete the operation
If cause cannot be determined after all the checks then just say reason is NotFound and complete the operation
completed
